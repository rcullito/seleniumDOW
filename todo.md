TODO
1. cause request to fail if email cannot be found in the database
2. fail if cassandra is not up and running


1. how to run selenium with phantomjs(maybe put this as a flag)
2. kick off on email rather than route being hit
(really it should be initiated by a post 
so the url can be passed up properly)
